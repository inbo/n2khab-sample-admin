## Welcome

This repo will keep track of:

- tables of sampling locations (+ attributes) in _Flemish Natura 2000 (n2k) habitat (hab) monitoring programmes_;
- code to update these tables, based on external data sources.

For more information on these monitoring programmes and on the relation with associated repositories, have a look at the repo [n2khab-monitoring](https://github.com/inbo/n2khab-monitoring).
